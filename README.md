# Suicide Rate Prediction with Bayesian Modelling

Nordic countries including Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland, have been always spotted to be in the top ten of the World Happiness Report recent years. It cannot be denied that the reliable welfare benefits, low corruption, and well-functioning democracy have been the most prominent explanations behind this. However, taking a deeper look into the other side of happiness, mental health is a worth considering barrier to subjective well-being. 

The aim of this project is to analyze the number of suicides in Nordic countries and give a prediction on the suicide rate in the future by building a Bayesian model. The prediction could provide a better understanding of the cases and help the authorities to decrease the number of suicides. In this report, the number of suicides by countries, by age groups will be examined and discussed. Moreover, the case of Finland will be investigated further.
